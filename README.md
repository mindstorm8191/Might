A dark Tower Defense game

Ethan is right; we need to keep this simple. Or at least, the game should start simple.

The story plan so far

1.  Beginner levels; players learn to play the game. This will be 5-10 levels; players will not be able to complete the last level without replaying previous ones at harder levels (thus engraining the need to replay early levels with harder settings to advance).
2.  Meet other wizards. The player will meet 3 other wizards along the way (maybe 1 at a time, or maybe all 3). The difficulty will ramp up, and players will start playing cooperatively with the other wizards; this will become necessary to pass levels.
3.  Get the bad guy's attention (we need a name for this, besides The Forgotten. Maybe just The Darkness?). This will start out by the bad guy merely noticing your existence (showing up as a dark presence). Later levels it will add influence to the battle; giving monsters bonuses, destroying towers and things. The bad guy's influence will continue growing.
4.  Get sucked into the darkness. Players will attempt to enter a fortress. Just before they win that battle, a hole will suck them all into a dark area. Lighting torches, they discover an active orb and have to start a fight without any lights around them (fortunately, towers emit some light). All battles after this will begin in darkness, requiring players to spread lights around to see what monsters are coming, and what other elements are in the area. Also, players will be unable to access any previous levels, having no way to return to where they were.
5.  More direct fights with the Darkness creature. Fights will get harder, using more negative battle elements. Players will enter a fortress (just entering will be a huge battle). There will be multiple seals that have to be broken before getting into the center of the fortress. There the player will have their first fight with the Darkness directly.
6.  The chase. The Darkness will start fleeing, and the player's group will follow. Fights will get harder, and the Darkness will become more desperate to escape. It will begin travling up a mountain, seeking something inside it.
7.  Does the Darkness manage to escape? Can the players destroy it? I don't know yet.
